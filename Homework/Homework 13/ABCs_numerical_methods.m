% This is a multi-part problem.  Do each of the parts below.
%
% DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION HEADER (the first line of code)
%
% Problem Parts:

% a) interp1. Find the y values that correspond to the xi values using
% linear interpolation from the vectors x and y. (A)


% b) spline. Find the y values that correspond to the xi values using
% the spline method from the vectors x and y. (B)


% c) polyfit. Find the coefficients of the fifth order polynomial that best
% fits the points represented by vectors x and y. (C)


% d) polyval. Evaluate the polynomial found in part c at the points in the
% vector xi. (D)


% e) diff. Approximate the derivative, dy/dx, for the vectors x and y. (E)


% f) Approximate the second derivative for the vectors x and y. The
% x vector should consist of all except for the last index of the original
% x vector used in the previous part. (F)


% g) cumsum. Find the cumulative sum of the elements in x. (G)


% H) trapz. Find the area under the curve represented by x and y by using
% the trapzoidal method of approximation. (H)


% I) cumtrapz. (Stop laughing!) Find the cumulative area under the curve
% represented by x and y by using the trapzoidal method of approximation.
