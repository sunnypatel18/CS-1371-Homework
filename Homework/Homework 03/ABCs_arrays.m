% Directions:
% Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parantheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1 and store it in (GT).
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 

% Given Input Variables:
%   1. mat1 - An array of numbers 
%   2. mat2 - An array of numbers
%
% 1. Create an array that has the numbers 3 and 7 in the first row, 4 and 5
%    in the second row, and 13 and 2 in the third row. (A)
A = [3,7;4,5;13,2];
% 2. Create an array of ones that has 7 rows and 2 columns. (B)
B = ones(7,2);
% 3. Find the number of rows and columns in "mat1", and save the number of
%    rows in (C) and the number of columns in (D). 
[C D] = size(mat1);
% 4. Vertically concatenate the arrays "mat1" and "mat2". (E)
E = [mat1;mat2];
% 5. Take the top half of the array "mat2" - that is, take all of the 
%    columns and the first half of the rows. Assume there are an even 
%    number of rows. (F)
F = mat2([1:(end ./ 2)], :);
% 6. Transpose "mat2". (G)
G = transpose(mat2);
% 7. Linearize "mat1". "mat1" should go from a MxN array to a (M*N)x1
%    column vector. The new (M*N)x1 vector should be calculated by going
%    down the columns of "mat1". (H)   
H = reshape(mat1,[],1);
%8. Create an 5x3 array of logical values, or mask. The odd rows will be
%   all true, and even rows will be all false. (I)
I = logical([1,1,1;0,0,0;1,1,1;0,0,0;1,1,1]);
%9. Take the array from #8 and reshape it to a 3x5 array. (J) 
J = reshape(I,3,5);
