% ABCs of Iteration
%
% Directions:
% Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parentheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 
%
% Given Input Variables:
%   1. vec - a vector of numbers
%   2. num - an integer greater than 1

% 1. for loops. Fix the following for loop so that A is the vector vec in
% reverse order. Replace every ? with the necessary code. You must utilize
% the for loop to receive credit. (A)

% If vec is [1 2 3 4 5], then A should look like this after each iteration:
% [1]
% [2 1]
% [3 2 1]
% [4 3 2 1]
% [5 4 3 2 1]

A=[vec];
for ind=1:length(vec)      % ind are the indices of vec
A=[vec(end:-1:1)]; % Puts the next element from vec before everything in A
end

% 2. while loops. Use the following while loop to count the number of
% perfect squares between 1 and num inclusive. Store your answer in the
% variable B. Replace every ? with the necessary code. You must utilize
% this while loop to receive any credit. (B)
i = 1;                    % Start from 1
B = 0;                      % Initializes a counting variable
while i <= num               % When i is less than or equal to num
if mod(sqrt(i),1)==0  % Checks to see if sqrt(i) is an integer
% root
B=B+1;              % Increment the counter if an integer is found
end
i = i+1;            % Moves to the next index position
end
end
