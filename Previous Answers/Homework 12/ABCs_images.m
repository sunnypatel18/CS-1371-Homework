function [A B C D E] = ABCs_images(img1, img2)
% ABCs of Images
%
% This is a multi-part problem. Do each of the parts below.
%
% DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION HEADER (the first line of code)

% a) imread. Read in the image matrix of the file whose name is stored in
% the variable img1. Store the image matrix in a variable named A.
%
% Write your code here:
A = imread(img1);

% b) Flipping images. Create a copy of A and then flip both the rows and
% columns of the image. Store your result in B. Do *NOT* use the flipup()
% or fliplr() function. 
%
% Write your code here:
B = A(end:-1:1,end:-1:1,:);

% c) Swapping colors. Swap the green and blue layers of A. Store your
% result in C.
%
% Write your code here:
C = A;
C(:,:,3) = A(:,:,2);
C(:,:,2) = A(:,:,3);

% d) Grayscale. Store the grayscale of the image matrix A in the variable
% D. Use the simpler grayscale formula where the pixel value is the average
% of the three layers. Do *NOT* use the weighted average formula or any
% built-in MATLAB functions such as rgb2gray() or gray(). Note: First the
% image matrix will need to by type double, and the final image needs to be
% returned to uint8.
%
% Write your code here (it will be a few lines):
D = double(A);
[r c d] = size(D);
i = 1;
j = 1;
while i <= r
    while j <= c
        avg = (D(i,j,1) + D(i,j,2) + D(i,j,1))/3;
        D(i,j,:) = avg;
        j = j + 1;
    end
    i = i + 1;
end
D = uint8(D);

% e) Negative. Store the negative of the image matrix A in the variable E. 
%
% Write your code here:
E = 255 - A;

% f) imwrite. Write a new image that is similar to the image matrix A,
% except that the values should be a third as bright. The name of the new
% image is stored in the variable img2. 
%
% Write your code here:
img2 = double(A);
img2(:,:,1) = (img2(:,:,1))/3;
img2(:,:,2) = (img2(:,:,2))/3;
img2(:,:,3) = (img2(:,:,3))/3;
img2 = uint8(img2);
imwrite(img2);
end
